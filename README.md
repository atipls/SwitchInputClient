# SwitchInputClient
Use your PC/Mac's keyboard with the Switch

A very WIP project to use an ESP32 to emulate a Nintendo Switch joycon.
Firmware adapted from https://github.com/nullstalgia/UARTSwitchCon/tree/master/ESP32

Connection is flaky for now, and the key bindings are hardcoded for Fortnite.
